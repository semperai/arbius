## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, you might want to get some Arbius tokens. You can simply [try Arbius](https://arbius.ai/generate) with a 0 fee Kandinsky 2 request and it will probably get solved. Once you're ready, head over to the [quickstart](/quickstart) guide which will show you how to start mining and performing other tasks using Arbius.
