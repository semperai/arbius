# Model Tokens

Every model registered in Arbius automatically gets its own ERC20 token. These tokens represent fractional ownership in the model and its fee revenue.

---

## What are Model Tokens?

When you register a model in Arbius, the protocol automatically deploys an ERC20 token contract for that model. These tokens:

- Are created at model registration
- Follow the ERC20 standard
- Can be traded freely
- Entitle holders to model fee revenue
- Represent fractional ownership

## Token Distribution

The initial token supply goes to the model creator:

```solidity
// At registration, all tokens minted to msg.sender
modelToken.mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_SUPPLY)
```

**Default Supply**: 1,000,000 tokens (configurable)

## Fee Revenue Sharing

Model token holders receive a share of the fees generated when their model is used:

### How it Works

1. User submits task for your model
2. Task is solved by validator
3. Model fee is collected
4. Treasury takes percentage (via `solutionModelFeePercentage`)
5. **Remainder goes to model owner address**

### Distribution to Token Holders

The model owner (token holder) receives fees to the model's registered address. If you want to distribute these fees to all token holders:

**Option 1: Manual Distribution**
- Collect fees to owner address
- Manually distribute to token holders proportionally

**Option 2: Fee Distributor Contract**
- Deploy a fee distributor contract as the model owner
- Contract automatically splits fees to token holders

**Option 3: Staking Contract**
- Create a staking contract for model tokens
- Distribute fees to stakers

## Use Cases

### 1. Model Ownership Transfer

Transfer ownership by selling model tokens:

```typescript
// Sell tokens = transfer ownership share
await modelToken.transfer(buyer, amount)
```

### 2. Fractional Ownership

Multiple parties can co-own a model:

```typescript
// Initial creator holds 1,000,000 tokens
await modelToken.transfer(partner1, 300_000) // 30%
await modelToken.transfer(partner2, 200_000) // 20%
// Creator retains 500_000 (50%)
```

### 3. Community Models

Distribute tokens to community:

```typescript
// Airdrop tokens to community members
for (const member of community) {
  await modelToken.transfer(member, allocation)
}
```

### 4. Liquidity Provision

Provide liquidity on DEXs:

```typescript
// Add liquidity on Uniswap/Sushiswap
await modelToken.approve(router, amount)
await router.addLiquidity(modelToken, WETH, ...)
```

## Getting Model Token Address

Find the token contract for any model:

```typescript
// Get model token address
const model = await engine.models(modelId)
const tokenAddress = model.token

// Interact with token
const ModelToken = await ethers.getContractAt('ERC20', tokenAddress)
const balance = await ModelToken.balanceOf(holder)
```

## Token Holders and Governance

While token holders receive fee revenue, they do **not** automatically get:

- Ability to change model parameters (only original owner)
- Ability to pause the model (only original owner)
- Governance rights over model settings

The model owner address retains administrative control. Token ownership is purely financial.

## Best Practices

### For Model Creators

1. **Consider tokenomics early** - Plan distribution before launch
2. **Set up fee distribution** - Implement automatic distribution if desired
3. **Provide liquidity** - Make tokens tradeable on DEXs
4. **Communicate clearly** - Explain token utility to holders

### For Token Holders

1. **Understand the model** - Research what the model does
2. **Check fee revenue** - Verify the model generates usage
3. **Monitor performance** - Track model task volume
4. **Liquidity awareness** - Understand token liquidity before buying

## Advanced: Fee Distributor Contract

Example distributor contract for model tokens:

```solidity
contract ModelFeeDistributor {
    IERC20 public modelToken;

    // Receive fees from model
    receive() external payable {}

    // Claim proportional fees
    function claim() external {
        uint256 balance = modelToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        uint256 totalSupply = modelToken.totalSupply();
        uint256 share = (address(this).balance * balance) / totalSupply;

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(share);
    }
}
```

Set this contract as the model owner to automatically collect and distribute fees.
