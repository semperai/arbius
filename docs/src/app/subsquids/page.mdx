# Subsquids

Subsquids aggregate data from the Arbius Protocol and provide a GraphQL API to query the data. You can use the Subsquid API to query the data and build your own applications, and you can run your own Subsquid as well. The Subsquid API is available on both the mainnet and testnet. Learn more about [Subsquids](https://docs.squidswap.io/).

<Note>
Currently public Subsquids do not index tasks, solutions, or claims. This is because the data is too large to index and would require a large amount of storage. If you need to query this data, you can run your own Subsquid and index the data yourself.
