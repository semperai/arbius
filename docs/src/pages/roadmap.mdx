# Roadmap

Arbius envisions a future where artificial intelligence transcends current limitations, by embracing decentralization, empathy, and economic innovation.

This foundation ensures that AI capabilities are not just advanced but also universally accessible, breaking down barriers to entry and fostering innovation on a global scale.

Our roadmap outlines our vision where Decentralized AI democratizes global computational power, AI with Empathy blurs the line between human and machine interaction, and AI Capitalism redefines economic productivity, in a world where AIs and humans work and co-exist together.

Our goal is to ensure AI can be free, in the sense of liberty, and to build tools and protocols to ensure open access to both humans and AI equally.
