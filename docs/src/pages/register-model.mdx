# Adding Models

You should be familiar with basic software packaging and basic usage of linux. If you have any questions please join our telegram. This guide aims to help you deploy a model onto Arbius assuming little prerequisite knowledge of how Arbius or blockchains function.

## Software requirements

Arbius uses a templating system that is built on top of `cog`, `docker`, and `ipfs`. First let's install these so we don't have to worry about installing them halfway through the guide.

1. Install [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

2. Install [cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog)

3. Install [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/).

4. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

## Write or modify cog model 

Cog provides a standardized http interface for clients to interact with your model. You **must** ensure there is a `seed` parameter which takes an `int` argument.

You can see an example of a commit which implements `seed` [here](https://github.com/kasumi-1/Kandinsky-2/commit/aa5ee2f68a1785b0833d32c27dff097b9b5e8f47).

If you are unfamiliar with cog, [this guide](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/push-a-model) on writing your first cog file should be followed prior to continuing with this guide.

### Build and run container

```bash
cog build
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --gpus all <your-model-name>
```

### Verify reproducibility

In addition to normal testing of model, you must ensure seed results in reproducible results. You can easily do this by passing same seed value in multiple times with curl and checking output. For example, this is how you may do it for a model:

```bash
curl --verbose http://127.0.0.1:5000/predictions -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d  '{"input":{"prompt":"turtle in heaven", "width": 768, "height": 768, "seed": 33111, "num_inference_steps": 50}}'  | jq -r ".output[0][22:]" | base64 --decode | sha256sum -
```

<Note>
  Make sure you restart container after testing and test again.
</Note>


## Uploading to replicate

This allows anyone to easily use your model and to and test it using the replicate interface.

https://replicate.com/create

```bash
cog login
cog push r8.im/<your-username>/<your-model-name>
```

Navigate to [https://replicate.com/\<your-username\>/\<your-model-name\>/edit](https://replicate.com/\<your-username\>/\<your-model-name\>/edit) and set the description, git repo, hardware, and public status.


## Writing template schema

Arbius uses a template schema file to know which parameters a model takes, and what sort of data a model generates.

This closely follows the cog spec, but has some certain differences.

### `meta` property

Contains `title` , `description`, `git`, `docker` and `version` properties.

* `title` refers to the models name. Please ensure it is unique by affixing suffix if it has some slight modification from existing model in use in Arbius.
* `description` provides information about the model.
* `git` refers to git repository.  On github you can press `y` for url to change to link to most recent commit
* `docker` refers to docker repository. You can populate this with the link generated from `cog push`.

<Note>
It is very common for different hardware to produce different results. You should include your specific hardware configuration (specifically GPU) in the title and/or description.
</Note>


### `input` property

Each input in the schema is provided in a list of `input`. All of these contain the following properties:

* `variable` name of the variable
* `type` one of:
* * `string`
* * `int`
* * `decimal`
* * `string_enum`
* * `int_enum`

* `required` whether or not the property is required or optional. usually only the prompt is required.
* `default` the default value for the input
* `description` the description shown to users under the variable name

Some types take additional properties:

`*_enum` types take a `choices` property which lists the values for the enum.

`int` and `decimal` take `min` and `max` properties.

### `output` property

Each file output has an entry in the `output` property. Each of these items contain two properties:

* `filename` the filename referenced from the IPFS folder / output

* `type` which is one of:
* * `image`
* * `video`
* * `text`
* * `audio`

Setting these correctly will allow interfaces to render an appropriate player for the output type.

### Example template schema

This is the template schema used for Kandinsky 2 model on Arbius.

## Registering model with Arbius 

### Get Ethereum on Arbitrum Nova

To register a model you will need some amount of Eth on the Arbitrum Nova network.

For bridging assets, you have a few options:

* [Official bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2chainId=42170)
* [SideShift](https://sideshift.ai/)
* [Multichain](https://multichain.org/)

On Arbitrum Nova transactions are usually subcent. A few dollar equivalent in Eth is fine for all experimentation and deployment.

### Set up Arbius locally

Next, you will want to set up Arbius which provides a command to register models. 


```bash
git clone https://github.com/semperai/arbius.git
cd arbius/contract
cp env.example .env
$(EDITOR) .env
```

Replace `NOVA_PRIVATE_KEY='REPLACEME'` with your private key
Your private key can be found in MetaMask by clicking "account details".

<Note>
  Your private key should not start with `0x`.
</Note>

Next, complete installation of Arbius cli tools by running:


```bash
nvm use
npm i -g yarn # optional if you already have it installed
yarn
```


### Finalize template file

Place your template file in `/arbius/templates/<your-model-name>.json`. You should remove all unused whitespace by running:

```bash
cat [your-template-file].json | jq -c > templates/[your-template-file].json
```

### Upload template to IPFS

All Arbius files are accessible over IPFS. You can pin your template file locally by running:

```bash
ipfs add templates/[your-template-file].json
```

Which will result in a `CID` (Content IDentifier). Others miners are likely to mirror this too.

### Register model

The following line will register a model with 0 fee, and it uses an unused address for the simplicity of this article.

```bash
npx hardhat --network nova model:register \
--address "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001" \
--fee "0" \
--template templates/[your-template-file].json
```

This will result in a line like:

```text
Model registered: 0x873de8267de30d5650091ef5467f682b3d2736522ed58ee3fc40f1244941feaf

Add the following to...
```

Follow the instructions generated to store in the `arbius/contract/scripts/config.json` file. Use a lowercase alphanumeric name for the key field as this will be used in code.

<Note>
  If you would like to create a fee collecting model, consider modifying and running `/contract/scripts/00x-deploy-paid-model.ts` - this will allow for integration into the main UI of Arbius on the `/models` page. You may however use any address, including your own. Remember to set the fee (in wei) correctly.
</Note>

## Adding model to the generate interface

1. **Import your model.** Add a line like:
```javascript
import ModelNameTemplate from '@/templates/modelname.json';
```
to the top of the file.

2. **Update the `models` array**. Add a line like:
```javascript
[Config.models.modelname.id, 'Model Name'],
```

to the list of models.

3. **Update `getModelTemplate`**. Add a new case section like:

```javascript
case Config.models.modelname.id:
  return ModelNameTemplate;
```

---

You should now be able to start the web server and view the template in the generation page:

```bash
cd arbius/website
nvm use
yarn
yarn dev
```

Now open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/generate` and see your model in the dropdown. Woohoo!

## Send PR to enable in interface

Please make a PR including your model to [https://github.com/semperai/arbius](https://github.com/semperai/arbius) so the website may be updated. 

## Next steps

If you are not a miner, at this point you should be requesting that other miners enable your model for mining. Reach out to the Arbius mining group on telegram. If you are one, continue to the [Mining guide](/mining) to see how you can enable this model for mining.
